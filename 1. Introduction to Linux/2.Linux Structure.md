## 🗂️ Root Directory `/` – The Grand Hall

Like the front door to a castle, everything begins here. It holds all the other rooms (folders) inside the Linux system.

## 🔚 Summary

The Linux file system is **hierarchical** and **organized by purpose**, not by user.

🧙‍♂️ "Remember, young sysadmin: Knowing the structure makes you a **castle guardian**, not just a tourist."
